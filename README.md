## Structure

`report/IR_report.pdf` holds the project report

`data` holds all the external data that we used, some data is missing from this repo because it's too big, but `README.md` and `.gitignore` files should point you where to get it.

`results` holds data and models generated by our code

`src` hold all the source code 

It's split up in two parts, classification and search + retrieval + interface

#### Classification
1. Preprocess the data by running the script in `src/preprocessing` directory, more info in the corresponding `README`
2. (Optional) generate word vectors by using the scripts in `src/generate_wordvectors`, more info in the corresponding `README`
3. Train models, validate models, and label our lexica data in `src/classification`,  more info in the corresponding `README`
